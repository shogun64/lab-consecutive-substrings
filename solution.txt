Please add your pseudocode to this file
And a written explanation of your solution

The function will take a string as an argument, and initialize an empty array.
Then, it will iterate through the string twice in a nested loop - the outer loop
for the starting point and the inner loop for the ending point. It will take the
substring between those two points and push it to the empty array. This will
repeat until all consecutive substrings in the string have been added to the
array, then return it. The Big O Notation for the function would be O(n**)

Pseudocode:
function consecutiveSubstrings(string)
    result = empty array
    Outer for loop, with variable i starting from 0 and going to length of the string
        Inner for loop, with variable j starting from 1 and going to the length of the string plus 1
            Push a slice of the substring from i to j to result
    
    Return the result array
